# Booleans, Functions and Loops

#### Setup
* Enter your browser's console. Do you remember how?

####
##### Booleans
* type `2 + 2 == 4`?
* Is that true?
* type `1 < 2`
* type `2 > 1`
* type `1 > 1 `
* type `1.0 == 1`


#### Functions

* type `function add (firstnumber, secondnumber) {return first number + second number;}``
* type `function hello () {console.log ("What's up!"};`
* type `hello();`
* type `add(1, 2)``
* What did you see?
* type `function helloname (name) {console.log ("What's up!" + name};`
* type `helloname("myname")` (except put in your name)
* What changed?

### Loops

* type `function ZeroToHundred () {for (var i = 1; i <= 100; i = 1 + i) {console.log(i)};
    console.log("Zero to a hundred real quick.");}`
* type `ZeroToHundred()`
* What's happening here?
* Retype the function, but this time count to 200. What did you need to change?
* type `function hotlinebling(repetitions) {for (var i = 1; i <= repetitions; i = 1 + i)
    {console.log("1-800-HOTLINEBLING   " + i)};}`
 * type `hotlinebling(5)`
 * type `hotlinebling("5")`
 * Why didn't that work?
